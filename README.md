## Architecture
- This project is based on MVVM-C trying to respect the SOLID and Clean Architecture principles.
- The ViewModel is different in this architecture because she doesn't have business logic, her responsibility is only abstract the business model data into a struct that only makes sense to the presentation layer, trying not to expose those businesses model information at viewController.
- The layers into this architecture respect a unidirectional flow (viewController -> Interactor -> Presenter -> ViewController), this helps to prevent reference cycles.

## Continuous Integration
- This repository is integrated with `Bitrise` what means that every time that a pull request is open to the `master` branch the CI will run a build and the tests for the Pull Request, also when a merge occurs with the master the CI will run the build and the tests.
- The `Bitrise` label at this readme file shows quickly if the `master` is broken or if everything is fine(tests and build).
